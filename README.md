# Portfolio Project

## Description

As our second homework assignment, we were asked to create a preliminary portfolio consisting of three pages:

\*Home ("About" page): This page was the most difficult for me. I couldn't get the page to be responsive. I suspect I'll have to start from scratch and try it a different way.

\*Portfolio (work samples): I'm a technical writer, not a developer. I've also done some writing for Slate and other online sites. I had URLs and images handy, so I used them to fill out my portfolio page. The images are linked to my articles. Later I'll replace or supplement them with more technical writing samples.

\*Contact (form): On this page, I customized the form a bit:

**Added a header and footer
**Reduced the size of the profile image
**Added about a dozen additional country choices to the "Country" selector
**Changed the background color and the color of the outline around each input area
**Removed the redundant name prompts in the "First Name" and "Last Name" input areas
**Validated the HTML with this nifty tool: https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea, which caught a stray div tag and a misplaced body tag (kinda important!).

On all three pages, I added a favicon. I also incorporated a Google font called "Red Rose, cursive." The name is misleading, since the font is not cursive and there is no cursive variation available. The font is available in different weights, and I used two of them.
