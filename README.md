# Portfolio Project

## Description

This portfolio is for Melissa Kinsey, a technical writer in St. Louis, Missouri (hey, don't blame meâ€”I just live here). It consists of five pages, three of which were originally built as a homework assignment for the Columbia University Engineering Full-Stack Boot Camp. The other two pages, "Tech Writing" and "GitHub," were added later.

\*Home ("About" page): This page was the most difficult for me. I couldn't get the page to be responsive. The page works better now, but I suspect I'll have to scrap flexbox and just use CSS grid on this page.

\*Portfolio: In addition to tech writing, I do some hobby writing now and then for Slate and other online sites (that is, when I'm not also enrolled in a programming boot camp 20 hours a week). This page features my Slate stories.

\*GitHub: This page features some projects we've done in class. Still amateurish, for sure, but not bad for having built each of them in a week, right?

\*Tech Writing: This page features some of my tech writing samples. My attempt to password protect the page failed (for now), and I'm super careful about not violating any NDA I've signed with my current or a previous employer. But these samples don't give away any trade secrets, so I think I can post them publicly. (No doubt the foreign governments following my GitHub will be disappointed, though.)

\*Contact (form): Call me! 867-5309. I've got a blank space, baby. And I'll write your name.
